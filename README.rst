Granada (Graph-based Navigation in Databases)
=============================================
Conceptual Scaling and Navigation in Relational Databases.

Install dependencies by running "pip install -e <package_root>" (<package_root is the directory which contains setup.py)

Development is currently stalled. The program's design as a web application, with a Javascript front-end and Python back-end,
gets in the way of a more modular design, with modules spanning across both front- and backend.
These technical problems get in the way of development. A re-implementation e.g. in Angular might be the best solution.
